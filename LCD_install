This LCD can be calibrated using a program called xinput_calibrator which is pre-installed on the CD image. However, it was not pre-installed on original Raspbian OS. So in this case, you should get and install the program manually with

sudo apt-get install -y xinput-calibrator
Enter the following commands for touch screen calibration:

sudo DISPLAY=:0.0 xinput_calibrator
or select Menu -> Preferences -> Calibrate Touchscreen.
